# Career Replaceability Calculator

Calculate your career replaceability risk score based on AI automation, location, and experience.

## 🎯 What is this?

This tool helps you understand how vulnerable your career might be to AI automation and outsourcing. By analyzing your role, skills, location, and experience level, it generates a replaceability score (0-100) that indicates your obsolescence risk in the current market.

## ✨ Features

- **Role-based Risk Assessment**: Analyzes 10+ common job roles from Frontend Developer to Customer Support
- **Skill Mitigation**: Factors in strategic skills that reduce replaceability risk
- **Geographic Analysis**: Considers location-based outsourcing risks
- **Experience Weighting**: Accounts for how seniority affects automation vulnerability
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, dark-themed interface with smooth animations
- **Share Results**: Copy and share your replaceability score

## 📊 How It Works

The calculator uses heuristic modeling based on:

1. **Base Role Risk**: Each role has a base risk score reflecting current AI capabilities
2. **Geographic Modifiers**: High cost-of-living regions face higher outsourcing risk
3. **Experience Level**: Junior roles are more vulnerable; senior roles benefit from context
4. **Skill Mitigations**: Strategic skills like negotiation, crisis management, and people management reduce risk

The final score ranges from 5-98, categorized as:
- **< 30**: Irreplaceable 🟢
- **30-70**: Moderate Risk 🟡
- **> 70**: Highly Expendable 🔴

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool uses heuristic modeling based on current AI capabilities and labor market trends. It is an **estimate, not a prophecy**. The results are meant to provide insight and encourage career development, not to cause anxiety.
